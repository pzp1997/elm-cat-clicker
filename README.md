# Elm Cat Clicker

The primary purpose of this project is to increase my understanding of Elm.

When learning about JavaScript design patterns, I created an application called [Cat Clicker](https://github.com/pzp1997/CatClicker) that used the MV* pattern. I decided to recreate this application using Elm as an exercise.

Perhaps others will find this demonstration useful for understanding Elm, or at the very least, will find amusement in clicking on pictures of cats.
